# Project_Hotel_Reservation
This is a home page that has been designed using HTML and CSS.
The code you provided is an HTML webpage with basic structure and styling. The webpage includes a navigation bar, a main section with two subsections, and a footer.

The navigation bar consists of a logo, links to four pages (Home, Services, About Us, and Contact), and a "Book Now" button. The links are duplicated in a dropdown menu activated by a button with three horizontal lines ("hamburger" menu).

The main section has two subsections. The first subsection includes a title and a short paragraph about the hotel, along with a "See More" button. The second subsection is a form for users to submit a message to the hotel.

The footer includes icons linking to the hotel's social media pages and a copyright notice.

The CSS code includes styles for the navigation bar, links, button, main section, form, and footer. The styles are written in a separate CSS file, which is linked to the HTML file. The CSS code uses flexbox for layout and basic colors for styling. The page also imports jQuery and Font Awesome for additional functionality and styling.
